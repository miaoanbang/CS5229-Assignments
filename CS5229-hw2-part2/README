Please refer to the screenshot for the ping.

Please refer to handlePacketIn, proxyArpReply function.
Simply get the mac address mapping from RouterInterfaceMacMap and return it to source.

Subtask 2
################################################
Please refer to handlePacketIn, processIcmpRequest function.
The idea is to replace the incoming icmp request source address with the router interface address.
When request comes in, parse the payload and extract query id from payload and put the mapping into queryIDToSourceIPMap for icmp reply.

################################################
Please refer to handlePacketIn, processIcmpRequest function.
The idea is to replace the incoming icmp reply destination address with the client address.
Use the queryIDToSourceIPMap to get the destination address for the ping reply.

################################################
Subtask 4
################################################
Please refer to handlePacketIn, startUp function.
When packet comes in, put the query id and current time into queryIDToTimeoutMap.
At startup, register a schedule service to check queryIDToTimeoutMap one by one and clear the timeout query id related information from both queryIDToTimeoutMap, queryIDToSourceIPMap.

One of the most common example I have found is UDP hole punching https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching
It is widely used in p2p, direct client-to-client and VoIP.
UDP hole punching establishes connectivity between two hosts communicating across one or more network address translators. Typically, third-party hosts on the public transit network are used to establish UDP port states that may be used for direct communications between the communicating hosts. Once port state has been successfully established and the hosts are communicating, port state may be maintained either by normal communications traffic, or in the prolonged absence thereof, by keep-alive packets, usually consisting of empty UDP packets or packets with minimal non-intrusive content.
